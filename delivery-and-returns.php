            To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging. <br>
            If for whatever reason you are not happy with your purchase, contact us within 7 days of your order delivery date to initiate a return. Once we receive the items, we will issue a full credit of the purchase price less shipping.
